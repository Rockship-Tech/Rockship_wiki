# About 
Mermaid is a diagramming and charting tool built on JavaScript, designed to simplify the creation and modification of intricate diagrams using Markdown-inspired text definitions and a dedicated renderer. Its primary objective is to bridge the gap between development and documentation.

The challenge known as "Doc-Rot," a situation where documentation becomes outdated due to the time and effort required for diagramming and documentation, is effectively addressed by Mermaid. The dilemma arises because creating and updating diagrams is time-consuming, yet the absence of accurate diagrams and documentation can hinder productivity and impede organizational learning.

# Examples
Below are various examples showcasing the types of diagrams, charts, and graphs that can be created using Mermaid.
